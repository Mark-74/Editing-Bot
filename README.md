# Bot ClipGenerator ü§ñ
This repository contains a project of a Discord bot entirely written in *Python 3.10* that allows the generation of meme clips based on customizable input data chosen by the user.

## Purpose ‚ô•Ô∏è
The bot is designed to simplify the creation of engaging content by allowing users to upload a video. The bot will then add subtitles, crop the video accordingly, add another clip that appears at the bottom of the screen, and include background music.

## How to run üõ†Ô∏è
Our bot is designed to be run with the following `.env` file in the main directory of the project, containing the private keys for **Discord** and **AssemblyAI**.
```.env
token=xxx
assemblyai_key=yyy
```
You must also create a directory **clips** with all the **`mp4`** videos you want to use in your contents.

## Commands üí¨
* `/ping`: replies with **pong** if the bot is online.
* `/create raw_clip=[ARG1] video=[ARG2] music=[ARG2 | None] font=[ARG3] font_color=[ARG4]` : generates the clip with the choosen arguments.

## How does it Work üîå
The bot uses MoviePy to assemble the video by cropping the clips, adding music and subtitles. To add subtitles, the bot uses AssemblyAI API, which provides a free key. Then, the bot uses FFmpeg to optimize the video size. Finally, the result is sent to the user via Discord direct messages.
